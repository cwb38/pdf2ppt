# PDF-to-PPT script
This repository contains a Python script to convert a PDF presentation into a Powerpoint presentation. 
Currently, the script hardcodes the names of the input PDF and output PPT, so you will have to change the names before running the script.
It automatically chooses 16:9 ratio slides rather than 4:3 ratio slides, but these can also be adjusted in the script.
Furthermore, the script creates PNG files for every slide in the PDF, so you may want to run the script in a separate folder.
